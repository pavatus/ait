## How to link items
On the console, find the **telepathic circuit** and right click it with the linkable item.

## How come my sonic isn't linking?
For the sonic screwdriver specifically, you will need to insert it into the **sonic port** for it to link properly.

## Any useful commands?
Certainly! the command to link different linkable items (like the sonic/keys/Stattenheim remote (which is a creative only item)) its:
> /ait link <tardis_id>
And that should link your currently held item.
