## What Is It?
**Artron energy** is the fuel the TARDIS runs on. It is known in the TARDIS itself as *"AU"*, 
or just simply as a percentage. It comes from rifts in Overworld, or passively anywhere.

## Where Is It Collected From?
**Artron energy** is collected by the TARDIS during **refueling**, 
and can be passively gained from anywhere (slowly) or gained in 
larger amounts quicker in a [**rift chunk**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-01-26-rift-chunk %}).
