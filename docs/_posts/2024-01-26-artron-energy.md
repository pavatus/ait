## What Is It?
**Artron energy** is the fuel the TARDIS runs on. It is known in the TARDIS itself as *"AU"*, 
or just simply as a percentage. It comes from rifts in Overworld, or passively anywhere.

---

## Where Is It Collected From?
**Artron energy** is collected by the TARDIS during **refueling**, 
and can be passively gained from anywhere (slowly) or gained in 
larger amounts quicker in a [**rift chunk**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-01-26-rift-chunk %}).

It can also be collected in **Artron Collectors**, which come in block and item form.

## Artron Collector Panel

It is crafted with this recipe:

![Artron Collector Panel Recipe](../assets/ac-item-recipe.png)

To use it, simply hold the item in your hand while in a rift chunk, and it will drain the chunk.
To fill up your tardis with it, crouch right-click the console.

## Artron Collector Block

It is crafted with this recipe:

![Artron Collector Block Recipe](../assets/ac-block-recipe.png)

It works the same as the panel, but instead it doesn't require you to hold the item. It is instead placed down.

You shift right-click this block with a panel to drain its storage
