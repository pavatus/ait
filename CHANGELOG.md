# 1.2.33
- New Steam Variant: Cherry
- Max increment changed to 10,000.
- Max fuel amount changed to 50,000au.
- Fixed telepathic circuit being broken
- Added functionality to the hammer, hitting the console with it now speeds up flight at a cost 😉
- Hitting the console with a hammer causes the tardises "hammer annoyance" to go up, when it reaches 10 your tardis will crash, the crash severity depends on how high your annoyance is
- Fuel cost goes up the higher the hammer annoyance is, and you get diminishing returns
- Fuel cost per hammer hit, affected by annoyance
- Hammer annoyance decays by 1 every 10 seconds
